"""Rough-cut phase (INI-085 Phase 2).

Turns a transcript into the **editable decision file** — the product of this
phase — and renders a regenerable rough cut from it. Taste (pacing, the comedic
pause) stays with the CEO; the machine does mechanical labor: dropping filler,
false starts, and dead air.

Layering mirrors the reframe phase:

  - ``transcript`` — a ``Transcriber`` Protocol seam (mlx-whisper behind it on the
    daily driver; ``FixedTranscriber`` in tests) + word-level timestamp model.
  - ``propose``    — pure: transcript + duration + config -> a full-timeline
    partition of KEEP/DROP segments, honoring ``rough_cut.trim_filler``.
  - ``decision``   — the decision file (``Segment`` / ``DecisionList``), a clean
    YAML round-trip. Editing an entry and re-rendering changes the cut.
  - ``render``     — pure: a ``DecisionList`` -> an FFmpeg ``trim``/``concat``
    argv (kept segments only; ``source/`` is never modified).
  - ``runner``     — daily-driver glue (transcribe -> propose -> write -> render).

Only ``runner`` and the mlx-whisper transcriber need native deps / footage; the
rest is pure and unit-tested in the sandbox.
